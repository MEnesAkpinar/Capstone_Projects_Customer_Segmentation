Welcome to "Clustering (Customer Segmentation) Project". This is the medium project of Machine Learning.

At the end of this project, I have performed Cluster Analysis with an Unsupervised Learning method.

In this project, customers are required to be segmented according to the purchasing history obtained from the membership cards of a big mall.

After getting to know the data set quickly, I expected to perform Exploratory Data Analysis. I observed the distribution of customers according to different variables, also discovered relationships and correlations between variables. Then I spesified the different variables to use for cluster analysis.

Finally, I clustered customers using the K-Means Clustering method, after that label the clusters.
